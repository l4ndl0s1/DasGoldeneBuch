    title: 'Befreiende Evas',
   
    description: `"You cannot avoid being subjective." - Doris Lessing reminds us in The Golden Notebook that our path to overcoming fears lies in writing about personal experiences. Our problems are not solely our own - when we share our stories, we speak for many others whose experiences mirror our own.

As a student in Austria, I took on multiple roles to support myself: dishwasher, cleaner, advertiser, barmaid, teacher, artist. Each role revealed how sharing and multiplying these identities led to freedom. This realization inspired "Befreiende Evas", a project exploring women's* emancipation as both a reflection of and response to our fragmented world.

"Befreiende Evas" emerges from the complex identities of women* who appear simplified in official records. We reject simple categorizations like "worker, girlfriend, politician, housewife, mother." Instead, we collect memories, feelings, documents, news clippings, stories, and artworks in an avant-garde fanzine format. Women* from all backgrounds are invited to contribute.

"Every woman* will add her stone to this project, building the moral structure of our future." We aim to create an "identity gateway" questioning not just female identity but also ethnic, class, and ideological identities. Additionally, we organize monthly Golden Days in Turkey, where women* gather to connect, share, and support each other.`,

    title: 'Das goldene Buch',
 
    description: `"The Golden Book" is the result of the essentially fragmented identities of women* who appear as a whole in official records such as "worker, friend, lover, active politician, artist, housewife, mother", etc. With great effort, we have to keep these subdivisions separate, but when this fails, something new emerges from the chaos of formlessness: The Golden Book! To explore this fragmentation, the participants developed an idea for a photocopy magazine in each workshop. 
The final zine, 'The Golden Book' is formed by the collective efforts of many women, addressing professional, personal, and social aspects of identity. The project culminates in a celebratory final event with art, performances, and discussions, showcasing the documented workshop journey and the final zine publication. The Golden Book is a cultural project funded by SHIFT, Basis Kultur Wien and organized by Fabrikraum Kultur und Kunstverein.`,

Performance and Lectures,

In these two performative evenings, which will follow the first workshop of the Das Goldene Buch project, we will experience three different performative approaches that engage art with activism. All interested in the issues of trans-inclusive, queer feminism, anti-war, anti-discriminatory activism, ecology, and more than human identities, the artists will present a set of variety of manifesting political and artistic expression. Following the workshop, Zeynab Kirikou Gueye will perform 'Homecoming', an artwork based on story-telling and a semi-hybrid DJ Set. Sharing the nuances of learning about belonging through their embodied experience of returning to Senegal, a place of their ancestry, they will question what power lies in a Black queer consciousness multiplied by racially distinct contexts. On our second evening, anto_nie will present a lecture, taking you a ride into the world of queer/coded villains, queer monstrosity, and its representation in horror movies. After that, Marina Leo will perform a rap performance "When somewhere there becomes somewhere here", dealing with political oppression and queer resistance, based on the manifesto-songs of the Techno-Poetry cooperative, of which Marina is a member. The Resilience & Care performance program is supported by 15. Bezirk/Rudolfsheim`,

HERTA MÜLLER Zine-Workshop zu Wörter-Collagen / Zine Workshop with Word-Collages:
Fabrikraum Kunstverein
Inspired by the Herta Müller technique of "collage-poetic" writing, in this workshop, we will elevate word collages and writing with images into true poetic works of art - a combination of scissors and paper with profound meaning. We encounter words everywhere, and each one of them is capable of telling a whole story. We will cut out letters and words from newspapers, magazines, and advertising brochures together. With our life plans, experiences, and a feminist sense of design, we will combine these fragments into new texts and create captivating collages.

    title: 'Frauen Matinee',
   
    description: `"Women's Matinée is a cultural project, inspired by the tradition of women's matinées in 1960s Istanbul. Our first project, Befreiende Evas, was inspired by the tradition of Golden Day (Altin Günü), which holds an important place in Turkey's cultural memory. On a Golden Day, women take turns gathering in each other's homes and bringing a piece of gold to the host, creating a cycle of solidarity that transcends economic dependence on men. This practice not only allows women to create their own economy but also fosters the sharing of collective experiences.
Inspired by Golden Day, we expanded our thinking about women's solidarity in a broader context. In this context, Women's Matinées emerged as a historical example offering women an accessible alternative in both economic and cultural spheres. Matinées are women-only artistic and performative events designed especially for working- and middle-class women, held during daylight hours. These events aim to create a space of liberation for women by transcending the class and gendered boundaries of art.
Das Goldene Buch/ The Golden Book / Altın Kitap aims not only to revive the collective practices of the past but also to transform them from a feminist perspective. From the women's matinees of Istanbul to the salons of France, from the Ottoman baths to the marketplaces of Africa, we seek to rethink these communal spaces that women have built throughout history.
The workshops, performances, gastronomic experiences, and discussions organized as part of the Women's Matinee project aim to strengthen women's practices of learning from one another. The works that emerge from these events will be presented in an exhibition and published in the Das Goldene Buch Fanzine, the collective memory of feminist solidarity. DGB continues to redefine art as a means of expression and resistance by giving voice to each female participant."`,
